	-Install "no_hats_bgum.vpk". The other mods are only here to give a bit more choice.



How to use the mod(s)?

	-Place the .vpk files you chose into your "custom" folder.
	(steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom)

Credits

"no_hats_bgum" is the main mod. Like "no_hats_orig", it's based on jeebsau's No Hats Mod. It was made possible thanks to mechbgum. Thank you for your work!

"no_hats_orig" is an outdated version of the mod. Based on jeebsau's No Hats Mod, wich is also an updated version of Hrbls' mod, itself an updated version of Tricky_X's mod.

"no_skins" (doesn't work on Valve servers) is a small mod I made myself. (Read the bug_list.txt first if you want to use this one!)

"no_christmas_lights" is a small mod I made myself.

"no_bugged_misc" is for people who want bugged hats to not be rendered, wich will cause pyro's head to be invisible sometimes. (no_hats_bgum leaves those miscs appear by default, for visibility reasons.)

"no_unusuals" (doesn't work on Valve servers) was a really outdated mod coming from StabbyStabby's config who was completely updated by Zach. Thank you for your work!
