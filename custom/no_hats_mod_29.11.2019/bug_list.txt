Here are some of the bugs and known issues of the mod. Look at this if you want to report a bug, to see if it's not already listed.



	1) The Last Breath, the Apparition's Aspect and some other hats don't work with "no_hats_bgum", no idea why, so they are always shown.
	(you can hide them by installing "no_bugged_misc", but sometimes they will appear anyway.)


	2) Some cosmetics make the bodygroup appear red even if the player is in the blue team. E.g. Medic Mech-bag, Soldier's Slope Scopers.


	3) When using "no_hats_orig", an OUTDATED version of the mod, a lot of characters will have missing bodyparts. E.g. Soldier's hat,
	Pyro's head, Scout's cap, etc. "no_hats_bgum" fixes this problem.


	4) The Voodoo cursed souls cosmetics are not changed with this mod. Technically these are not hats, but entirely different models 
	overlapping the default ones (Whom their texture change). In short: there's no way to hide them, sadly.


	5) If you have the "no_skins" mod installed, weapons will load indefinitely. Move all of your "skinned" items at the end of your
	backpack. (This mod is really buggy, use it only if you despiiiiise weapon skins)



BEFORE REPORTING A HAT/COSMETIC, I would like if you could verify if it is not already in the bug list on this steam page:

Thanks in advance
